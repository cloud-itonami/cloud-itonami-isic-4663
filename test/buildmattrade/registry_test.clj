;; The building-materials-wholesale domain checks (credit-clearance,
;; contract-on-file, lead-free-certification, sanctions-screening) are
;; direct entity boolean reads in the governor, NOT pure registry range
;; functions -- so this registry has NO range-check suite to test
;; (unlike the crude-extraction sibling's reservoir/annular/water-cut/
;; H2S functions). Only record construction is here.
